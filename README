I've been playing with UITableView for a while so I've decided to write this tutorial in which I will cover everything I've used so far, from the basic data source to the the custom table cell. For the final goal of this tutorial I will use my favorite task management app - Wunderlist which is practically based on UITableView and it can serve as a great example!
